<h1>Q1 PROBLEM STATEMENT<H/1>
<B><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>You are given the ‘N’ processes with their “burst times”(p1=3,p2=2,p3=1,p4=4,p5=2), and the “arrival time” for each process is 0.
Your task is to find the “waiting time”, the “turn-around time” ,averge waiting and average turnaroung time of each process using the ‘FCFS CPU Scheduling’ algorithm.</B></P>
  <h1>Q2 PROBLEM STATEMENT<H/1>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Write a C program to implement Shortest Remaining time next (SRTN) CPU Scheduling algorithm.
    <B>Example:</B>
In this Example, there are five jobs P1, P2, P3, P4, P5. Their arrival time and burst time are (2,10) (1,5) (4,1) (0,6) (2,3).Your task is to find the “waiting time”, the “turn-around time” ,averge waiting and average turnaroung time of each process using the ‘SRTN CPU Scheduling’ algorithm</P>
